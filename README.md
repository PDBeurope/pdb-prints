[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/pdb-prints.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pdb-prints) 

A PDBprint for a PDB entry is a collection of PDBlogos displayed in a specific order, where each icon represents a well-defined category of information.

In PDBprints following categories are included:

* Primary citation: has the PDB entry been published?
* Taxonomy: what is the source organism of the biomacromolecule(s) in the entry?
* Sample-production technique: how was the sample of the biomacromolecule(s) obtained?
* Structure-determination method: which experimental technique(s) was used to determine the structure and was the experimental data deposited?
* Protein content: does the entry contain any protein molecules?
* Nucleic acid content: does the entry contain any nucleic acid molecules (DNA, RNA or a hybrid)?
* Heterogen content: does the entry contain any ligands (such as inhibitors, cofactors, ions, metals, etc.)?

It is a <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdb-component-library" target="_blank">PDB Component Library</a> component.
